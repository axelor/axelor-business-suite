title: "Manuf order: Add the possibility to merge manuf order"
type: feature
description: |
	In manuf order, we can now merge manuf order into one.
	For that we need to have the same product, workshop, and the draft or planned status.
	We add a merged status.
	On the merged manuf order we can see the list of manuf order that were merged.
	On each of the manuf order that were merged, we can see the result of the fusion.
